## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps. Include instructions on how to install software needed to run your project and commands to be executed.

### Prerequisites
This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation
Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote URL to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
